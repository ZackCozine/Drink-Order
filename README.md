Full-stack application with the intention of helping bar managers quickly and accurately price out drinks when creating new cocktail menus. 

## [Deployed Link](https://drink-order.herokuapp.com/)

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. It will also give an overview of some of the app's functionality. 

### Prerequisities

You will need MongoDB installed if you want to run this application locally. For help installing MongoDB, visit
````
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/
````

Once installed, make sure the MongoDB daemon is running with the following command line command:
````
$ mongod
````

### Installing

Git clone the repository to your local machine: 

HTTPS:
```
https://github.com/jckmrrssy/Drink-Order.git
```
SSH:
````
git@github.com:jckmrrssy/Drink-Order.git
````

To connect to your local Mongo database, you will need to add an .env file in the root of your cloned repository containing the following code:
````
MONGO_DB="mongodb://localhost/<you decide the name here>"
````

Next, cd into the repository you cloned and install the necessary dependencies by running:
````
$ yarn install
````

You will then be able to start the app locally by runnning:
````
$ yarn start
````

## Planned updates

At the moment, this app is the minimum viable product. We hope to make updates to improve the UI/UX, and add more pricing functionality and features (such as setting a target cost, markup %, etc). We also have plans to build out a mobile version of the application using React Native, to make it even easier for managers to quickly price out their menus.
